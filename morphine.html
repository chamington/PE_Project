                What are the street names for this drug?
            </h1>
            <p>
            Morphine isn't known to have many street names.  This is because morphine is mostly associated with medicine, and not much as a drug.  This is mainly due to morphine being used as a medicine instead of a drug.  However, it is a drug, which is addictive, and it has some street names.  These street names are:

                    Scientists in Germany continued to work on the development of morphine and in the mid-1800's came up with an effective, sure-fire solution to the addiction problem. It didn't work. It was called heroin.

                How can morphine effect a teenager mentally?
            </h1>
            <p>
            Morphine effects the amount of certain pleasure inducing chemicals in the brain. By stimulating the structures that release these chemicals, morphine acts to increase the amount circulating in the brain. In addition, there are naturally occurring opioids produced in the brain, called endogenous opioids. Morphine binds to the receptor sites for endogenous opioids and reduces the excitability of neurons. It is believed that this contributes to the euphoria experienced when using morphine.
