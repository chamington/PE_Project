                How can cocaine effect a teenager socially?
            </h1>
            <p>
            A study conducted at the University of Zurich finds that chronic users experience a steep decline in their ability to connect with others and properly socialize. The researchers wanted to examine cocaine's effect on socialization. To find out how cocaine impacts social interactions, the scientists divided their subjects into two groups - one comprised of regular cocaine users, the second a control group made up of non-users. The users showed less brain activity when it came to social reward, meaning cocaine users didn't find much pleasure or fulfillment in social encounters.
